The transcript is a conversation between two speakers, Kira Mooney and Shivan, who are presenting at a conference about React Native for Desktop. Kira introduces herself

In this transcript, the speaker discusses the various applications that Microsoft has built using React Native, including Microsoft Office, Outlook, Teams, Windows OS, Power Apps, and Xbox. They explain that these applications vary in their purpose and how they were built, with some being entirely built using React Native and others hosting React Native experiences within non-React Native applications. The speaker also discusses the challenges of going cross-platform, including the need for code sharing and maintaining a native look and feel across different platforms. They then walk through an example of a widely shared React Native experience within Microsoft Office called the Persona card, which is available across all four desktop and mobile platforms. The speaker also discusses various investments that Microsoft has made in developer experience, including Fluent UI React Native and React RxKit. They conclude by emphasizing Microsoft's commitment to React Native for desktop and encouraging the community to get involved in contributing and providing feedback.
